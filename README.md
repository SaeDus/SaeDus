## üëæ About Me

Oh hi! I am a **video game programmer** with a desire to create immersive gaming experiences. With a solid foundation in **Unity**, extensive experience with **Godot** while dabbling with **Unreal Engine**, and proficiency in **C#**, **GDScript**, **Python**, **C++**, and **JavaScript**, I love bringing virtual worlds to life.

I am continuously chasing an endless hunger awakened by my curiosity, always finding cool new things to recreate.

## ‚åö Currently Working On

I am currently working with Opera Skunk doing some contract work for a few other projects under NDA. The projects include genres such as **Tower Defense**, **Survival MMORPG**, and **Horror**. I always have a few other projects going, and I hope to bring many of these into the hands of players and other developers as soon as possible.
