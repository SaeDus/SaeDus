## üëæ About Me

Oh hi! I am a **viciously passionate video game programmer** with a knack for creating immersive gaming experiences. With a solid foundation in **Unity**, extensive experience with **Unreal Engine** and **Godot**, and proficiency in **C#**, **C/C++**, **Python**, **GDScript**, and **JavaScript**, I love bringing virtual worlds to life.

I spend all my time creating new projects that serve only as a playground for whatever piques my interest before moving on to the next. I am continuously chasing an endless hunger awakened by my curiosity.

## ‚åö Currently Working On

I am working with the small company, Opera Skunk, after the "Reign & Rebellion" project, I stayed on with them doing some contract work for a few other projects under NDA. The projects include genres such as **Tower Defense**, **Survival MMORPG**, and **Horror**. I always have a few other projects going, and I hope to bring many of these into the hands of players and other developers as soon as possible.
